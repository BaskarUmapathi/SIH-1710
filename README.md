## Problem Title
SIH 1710: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations
## Problem Description
Background: Railway stations are complex environments with numerous facilities and locations such as ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, food courts, and waiting areas. Passengers often face difficulties in navigating these spaces, especially in large or unfamiliar stations. Efficient and user-friendly navigation systems are crucial for improving passenger experience, reducing congestion, and ensuring timely travel connections. Description: The problem involves developing a comprehensive navigation solution for railway stations that assists passengers in locating various facilities and destinations within the station premises. This includes creating detailed maps, providing real-time directions, and integrating features such as accessibility options for individuals with disabilities. The solution should be intuitive, easy to use, and accessible via multiple platforms, including mobile devices and digital kiosks. Key challenges include updating navigation information in real-time, ensuring accuracy, and accommodating the diverse needs of all passengers. Expected Solution: The expected solution is a multi-platform navigation system that provides detailed, real-time directions to all facilities and locations within a railway station. This system should include: A mobile application with 3D interactive maps and step-by-step navigation. Digital kiosks located throughout the station with touch-screen interfaces. Voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers. Regular updates to reflect changes in station layout and facility locations. Integration with existing railway apps and services for seamless user experience. The solution should enhance the overall passenger experience by reducing confusion, saving time, and improving accessibility within the station.

## Idea
The core idea is to develop a smart navigation system for railway stations that helps passengers easily locate platforms, ticket counters, restrooms, waiting areas, and other amenities. The system will be available via:

A mobile app with 3D interactive station maps.

Touch-enabled digital kiosks installed at various station locations.

Voice assistance for the visually impaired. It will work in real-time and update itself as per station changes or temporary shifts in facility locations.

## Technology Stack
For the frontend, the mobile app will be developed using React Native, which works well across Android and iOS, while HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript will be used to create interactive touch-based digital kiosks. The backend of the system will be built using Node.js with Express.js, which allows smooth communication between the app, kiosks, and database. To store and manage data like facility locations and user queries, we will use MongoDB or Firebase Realtime Database. For indoor navigation, we’ll integrate Mapbox SDK or Google Maps API to show custom indoor station maps. For voice guidance, tools like Google Text-to-Speech or Amazon Polly will be used. Lastly, to ensure accessibility for everyone—including visually impaired users—the app and kiosks will support screen readers, large text options, and high-contrast modes for better visibility.



## Dependencies
Indoor Mapping API (Mapbox Indoor or Google Maps Indoor)

Voice API for speech support

GPS/Beacon System for precise indoor location tracking (optional)

Railway Data Integration API (IRCTC or relevant authority)

Accessibility Libraries for enhanced usability
